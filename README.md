The Connectivity Software is a suite of software development components, tools and applications. It works on .NET, COM and Python platforms, and consists of following products:
* [QuickOPC](https://github.com/OPCLabs/QuickOPC) (OPC client and subscriber development)
* Excel Connector ([OPC and Excel integration](https://www.opclabs.com/products/excel-connector))
* [OPC Wizard](https://github.com/OPCLabs/OPCWizard) (OPC server toolkit)

Connectivity Software products are commercially licensed. Some of the [tools are free](https://kb.opclabs.com/Tool_Downloads), 
and all functionality is available in free trial mode, which provides valid data for 30 minutes; after that period, 
the application needs to be re-started, and so on. You must also comply with licensing terms for 3rd-party material 
redistributed with Connectivity Software.
